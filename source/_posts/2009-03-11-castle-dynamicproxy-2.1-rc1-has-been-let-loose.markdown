Just posting a heads up to those who use Castle DynamicProxy.

DynamicProxy 2.1 RC1 has [just been released][1] and can be downloaded from [sourceforge][2].

If you are not already using the trunk please upgrade to this release, because the RTM will follow very shortly if there aren't any
reported issues. This release contains the .NET 2.0 and .NET 3.5 compatible binaries.

If you have any issues with DynamicProxy please post them in the Castle users or development mailing list.
