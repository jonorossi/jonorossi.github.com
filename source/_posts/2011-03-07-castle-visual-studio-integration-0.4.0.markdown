I have been extremely quiet on my blog for the last 12 months or so, however I'm alive and well, I just haven't had much to say.

After many requests for Visual Studio 2010 support for Castle Visual Studio Integration, I did the pretty painless work back in November 2010,
but just didn't get around to releasing it.

You can now download the source code from GitHub and get the binaries via the Visual Studio Extension Manager. See the [CVSI page][1] for full details.
