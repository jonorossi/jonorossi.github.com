As a follow up to [my post about getting a 24 port gigabit network switch][1], I have purchased one, but not the one I had planned to.

I did some more research recently before I ordered one and discovered the [HP ProCurve 1800-24G][2]. I never considered HP in any
previous research because I expected them to be expensive, however this one turned out slightly cheaper than the Netgear GS724T that
I was planning to buy.

The 1800-24G has many of the same features as the GS724T, including lifetime warranty. However, one difference is that the 1800-24G has
a less than 4.7 microsecond 100Mbps latency compared to less than 20 microseconds with the GS724T. The 1800-24G then also has a less
than 3.0 microsecond 1000Mbps latency.

If you or your employer is looking for a gigabit network switch then you should seriously consider the HP ProCurve 1800-24G over cheaper
brands. I have been really happy with it since I got it nearly a week ago.
