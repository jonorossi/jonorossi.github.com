Over the last week and a bit I have been working to get Castle Visual Studio Integration much more stable for a university tradeshow
where I will be presenting it this Wednesday. This release is much better than the 0.2.0 release that was really rough, which was why
I labeled 0.2.0 alpha.

This release also adds intellisense for 'foreach' directives, so that the loop iterator is added to the scope of the intellisense.

This release is like all the update releases I have made and it only comes with the assemblies, you will need to install CVSI 0.1.0
using the MSI and unzip the files into the installation directory. This allows you to go back to an older build if there are problems.
