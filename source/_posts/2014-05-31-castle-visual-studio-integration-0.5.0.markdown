I've had a few requests over the last year and a bit for Visual Studio 2012 and 2013 support for Castle Visual Studio Integration.
I released a preview with support for Visual Studio 2012 nearly two years ago, but last weekend bit the bullet after a
little push from [a long time user][3].

You can download the source code from [GitHub][2] if you are interested and you can get the binaries (a VSIX) from the
[CVSI page][1]. The 2012 and 2013 releases are not available through the Visual Studio Extension Manager, see the
[CVSI page][1] if you want to know why.
