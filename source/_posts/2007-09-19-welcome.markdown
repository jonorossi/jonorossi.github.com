Hello, my name is Jonathon Rossi and I'm a student nearing the completion of my Bachelor of Information Technology at QUT in
Brisbane, Australia. This is the mandatory first 'welcome to my blog' post that all new bloggers seem to do.

I'm a .NET software developer and am interested in the work many others are doing and have been a member of the Castle Project
open source community for a while. I don't have a set plan on what I will be blogging about, however it will probably include
current projects I am working on and details of the topics I am learning about.

Without further ado, welcome to my blog.
