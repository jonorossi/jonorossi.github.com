Today, I am announcing the first public preview of a RubyGems-inspired package manager for .NET, [Bricks][1].

Bricks is very basic at this point, however over the coming months I intend to continue improving it and its central repository to benefit
both myself and the wider community. At the moment the only thing I can guarantee is that things will break because supporting backwards
compatibility is not important.

I welcome you to download and take a look at Bricks. If you have ideas or want to discuss things I would prefer the discussion to occur on
the [mailing list][2], rather than the comments here.
