Since [Castle Project RC3 was released][1] this past week I thought I would let everyone know how Castle Visual Studio Integration
is progressing.

I have published a <u>screencast</u> (no longer available) of some of the work I am doing for Castle Visual Studio Integration Preview 2,
it is still early stages of being ready for use but it is starting to take some shape. I'd appreciate any comments about what you can see
so far.

Sorry about the large file size for such a short screencast, as well as the low framerate. Wink doesn't seem to compress it too well.
