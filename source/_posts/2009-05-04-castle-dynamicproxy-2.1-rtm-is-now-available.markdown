After so many years of the Castle Project never making an RTM/GA release, DynamicProxy with Castle Core is the first project after the
[split][1] to hit the gates running with a gold release.

You can head over to [sourceforge to download][2] 2.1 RTM if you so choose. However, the key part of this release is to allow projects
like the [Castle MicroKernel to RTM][3] with a released DynamicProxy.

There were several minor changes made between 2.1 RC1 and 2.1 RTM, see the Changes.txt for more details.
