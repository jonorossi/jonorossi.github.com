Earlier this morning on my commute, I drew a diagram of the dependencies between the various projects that form the Castle Project.
I drew it to get a overall picture of the order in which the releases of various projects are going to need to be made.

Just about every project depends on Castle Core so that dependency as well as implied dependencies have been left off to simplify the diagram.

Once a few projects get out the door officially it will probably be worthwhile converting this into a HTML page for the Castle web site.
I'd expect it would display the current released version number and link to the project's page, providing everyone with an easy way of
knowing what versions are available.
