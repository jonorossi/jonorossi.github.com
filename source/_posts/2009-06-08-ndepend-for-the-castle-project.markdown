I'd like to start by thanking Patrick Smacchia from [NDepend][1] for the free open source licence of NDepend Professional for use at the Castle Project.

I have finally got around to changing the build scripts to have NDepend running in our build so we can generate the NDepend code analysis report.

You can view the report in the artifacts of one of the <u>coverage/NDepend builds</u> (no longer available), or with this <u>direct link</u>
(no longer available) to the last successful build.

As you can see for yourself the report contains heaps of valuable information. I am yet to get a chance to blog about several things I have
realised while playing with NDepend, which I plan to do in the next few weeks when I get some more time.

For now, you can take a look at the report for yourself.
