In the last few months I have been using [Castle Windsor][1] in a project to improve its design and ease testing. I have found Windsor
pretty painless to work with and am amazed at the power that I hadn't tapped into that is available using a IoC container. If you
haven't had a chance to play with dependency injection and inversion of control then you don't know what you are missing out on.

[Oren Eini's article][2] on working with the Windsor container and the [4 part series by Simone Busoli][3], were very helpful with
getting started with Windsor alongside the [official documentation][4].

Another [very good article][5] that was written by James Kovacs, published in MSDN Magazine and released on the MSDN web site yesterday
would definitely serve as a very good introductory article which clearly explains the problem and how an IoC container can improve your
application's design.
