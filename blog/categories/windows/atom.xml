    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently ran out of ports in my network switch, so I moved my computer over to my router as shown below (which is now also full).
I noticed about a week ago that the light for my computer (port 4 of 4) was orange when my computer was off, according to my router's
manual an orange LAN light means it is running at 10Mbit instead of 100Mbit. My first thought was that my UPS had bugged my motherboard
because my UPS is faulty, but I didn't think that was right because I have <a href="http://www.velocityreviews.com/reviews/Thermaltake_ToughPower_550_Power_Supply/1/">a pretty nice PSU</a> that is meant to prevent any power problems.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/files/2008/Router10MbitConnection.jpg"></p>

<p>When I switched the network cable from one NIC in my motherboard to the other, the light went green, which made me nervous. Just to check
I plugged my computer into the wall socket for my laptop and it did the same thing which made me more nervous. After flicking the switch
on my power supply and waiting for my PSU to drain its capacitor, I turned it back on and the light on my router went green. That's when
I realised that Vista must be being too smart for itself and is running the NIC at 10Mbit when it turns off the computer to save power.</p>

<p>I am aware that Vista's support for <a href="http://www.acpi.info/">ACPI</a> (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is really good. It puts my computer to sleep
so the computer makes no noise and I can start using it again in only a second. I searched around for other people who have discovered
this and couldn't find any info that Vista does actually do this, so I can only assume that this is another nice feature of
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/soa/Microsoft-goes-on-green-Vista-offensive/0,130061733,339274460,00.htm">'Green Vista'</a> and that I really don't have any hardware problems.</p>

<p>Has anyone else seen the same behaviour?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was going to write a post about the issues I had with Windows Vista 64-bit since just before Christmas when I got my new machine,
however I just haven't had many problems. When I installed I had no problems with drivers and all the software except one thing
(no 64-bit support) has installed and run without problems so far.</p>

<p>I have found Vista 64-bit to be really stable and reliable, that's not to say I am not eagerly awaiting SP1 to fix several annoying
things with Vista, namely the copy/move file dialog. From what I have read of the <a href="http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/005f921e-f706-401e-abb5-eec42ea0a03e1033.mspx?mfr=true">changes for SP1</a>, Vista will become a much
more polished OS, just as SP1 and SP2 did for Windows XP.</p>

<p>I built my new AMD dual core machine when I got Vista 64-bit, so having no driver problems is most likely because all the hardware
was new and was supported on Vista 64-bit.</p>

<p>Before I built my new machine I was trying to decide whether I'd jump to Vista 64-bit with all the horror stories I had heard, let
alone the problems with Vista 32-bit. One of the reasons I decided to go with Vista 64-bit was that XP and Vista 32-bit only support
3GB of RAM and I wanted 4GB. There are countless other nice features like the search box in the start menu which make Vista in general
a much more featured OS. However, I have no regrets with going to Vista 64-bit and would assume I'd have a just as good experience with
Vista 32-bit and can only expect it to get better with the upcoming SP1 release.</p>

<p>Companies like Dell are currently selling PCs with 3GB of RAM running on Vista 32-bit. Computer manufacturers are now at the limit with
the amount of memory they can put in a machine for Vista 32-bit, which means that support for Vista 64-bit in software becomes so much
more important for ISVs. That means that all consumers will benefit from the improved 64-bit support throughout the software industry.</p>
